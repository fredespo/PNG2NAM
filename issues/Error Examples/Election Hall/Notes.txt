Error1(SOLVED): the palette applied to tiles where the columns meet the stairs has the shades of blues reversed from what they should be. 
*Solved by more accurately detecting if a tile is unique by identifying according to hex value (based on tile and palette). 

Error2: The main yellow-ish color is misrepresented in the palettes.
